Foreword:
This is a very simple game made by GoldJack.
If you want to deeper reading it , I am well welcome you to download the source code.
And I shall be extremely happy if you can pull me some requests.

Features achieved:
1. Create rooms(MainCity, Forge, Church, cave etc.) and join them on a map
2. Create monsters(boss only, for now) and a MainCharater
3. Spawn a boss in a room(Cave for now)
4. Battles(auto) between the MainCharacter and the boss
5. Gain kill bonus


Scheduled TODO: 
1. More skills, both positive and negative
2. More monsters, especially bosses
3. More friendly NPCs ( 0 for now )
4. Realize the interaction between the MainCharacter and NPCs

Last, great thanks for reading this file and project.
